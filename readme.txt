Author : Pierre Ghossoub

This game is an arcade-like 2D top down shooter.
It is a solo project for training purpose.
It has no commercial purpose.

It is a work in progress.
This is my first game, and I consider it like a training ground.

It was made with Unity 5.6.6f2

You can launch the game with RobotShooter_v1.1.exe, in the Builds folder.
